            <h1>The Robots Are Taking Over?!?!?!</h1>
            <p>Oh wait...that's not for another 7 years. Robots currently lack human creativity, intuition, and emotional intelligence. They are programmed to follow rules and algorithms, 
                and can't deviate from their instructions. Robots also require a lot of resources and human intervention to function, including power, maintenance, and programming.</p>
            <h1>Artificial intelligence (AI)</h1>
            <p>AI will continue to advance in various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. AI-powered systems can 
                perform tasks that are usually associated with human cognitive functions.</p>
            <h1>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)</h1>
            <p>AR and VR technologies will become more mainstream, allowing consumers to try products virtually, explore virtual stores, 
                and attend virtual events.</p>

        <div class="info-right">
            <h1>Internet of Things (IoT)</h1>
            <p>More devices will connect to the internet, enabling automation and communication across sectors like healthcare, 
                agriculture, and home automation.</p>
            <h1>Advanced robotics</h1>
            <p>Robotics technology will continue to evolve, creating machines that can perform complex tasks autonomously or with minimal human oversight.</p>
