            <h1>Bitcoin saw its value skyrocket!</h1>
            <p>Who needs an alternative to money that is out of the hands of banks and governments? Enough people, it seems, 
                that interest in bitcoin and other “cryptocurrencies” went mainstream in 2017, sending the price of bitcoin up 
                from underneath $1,000 at the start of the year to more than $14,000 by the end of 2017.</p>

            <h1>Practical Quantum Computers</h1>
            <p>Advances at Google, Intel, and several research groups indicate that computers with previously unimaginable power are finally within reach.</p>
