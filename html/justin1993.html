    <h1>You've landed in 1993!</h1>
    <p>Uncertainty fills your psyche, as you take in the lead infused car exaust, the sketchy transaction of a floopy disc from one shady character to another, and the sound of someone unironically playing the beastie boys on a boom box. You are certain of one thing.. this is the 90's and as the strange talking dog has suggested something is clearly afoot.</p>
