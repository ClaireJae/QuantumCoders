        <h3>The Introduction of the Internet (1993-2000)</h3>
        <p>From 1993 to 2000, the internet experienced rapid growth and transformation, marking a pivotal period in its evolution. The early 90s saw the introduction of important technologies, the formation of influential companies, and the beginning of the internet's commercialization.</p>
        <p>Technological advancements such as the development of the World Wide Web, the introduction of web browsers like Netscape, and the rise of early internet services laid the groundwork for the internet to become a global platform. These developments ultimately set the stage for the digital world we live in today.</p>

        <h3>1993: The Internet Expands</h3>
        <p>In 1993, the number of websites reached 600, and major institutions like the White House and United Nations went online. Marc Andreessen developed the Mosaic web browser at the University of Illinois, which would later influence the creation of Netscape Navigator. The number of computers connected to NSFNET grew from 2,000 in 1985 to more than 2 million in 1993, signaling the rapid expansion of the internet.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation began outlining a new internet architecture to support commercial usage, marking the early stages of the internet's transformation into a tool for business and society at large.</p>

        <h3>1994: Birth of Key Companies and Tools</h3>
        <p>In 1994, Netscape Communications was founded, and Microsoft introduced its first web browser for Windows 95, marking the start of the browser wars. This year also saw Yahoo! created by Jerry Yang and David Filo, initially as a directory called "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" before becoming a full-fledged search engine and portal in March 1995.</p>

        <h3>1995: Internet Becomes Commercialized</h3>
        <p>By 1995, the internet began to be truly commercialized. Internet service providers like CompuServe, America Online (AOL), and Prodigy offered access to the growing online world. E-commerce giants like Amazon.com, Craigslist, and eBay went live, laying the foundation for modern online retail and services.</p>
        <p>The original NSFNET backbone was decommissioned, marking the completion of the internet's transition from a government-funded research network to a commercial enterprise. 1995 also saw the launch of Match.com, the first online dating site.</p>

        <h3>1996: The Browser Wars Heat Up</h3>
        <p>The "browser war" intensified in 1996, primarily between Microsoft and Netscape, as both companies fought for dominance in the internet browser market. This period also saw CNET purchase tv.com for $15,000, and "The Dancing Baby," a 3D animation, became one of the first viral videos online.</p>

        <h3>1997: New Beginnings in Tech</h3>
        <p>In 1997, Netflix was founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph as a DVD rental-by-mail service, marking the beginning of what would become a global streaming giant. Additionally, a significant legal battle resulted in a settlement that allowed PC makers to remove or hide Microsoft’s internet software on new versions of Windows 95. Netscape also announced that its browser would be free, further intensifying the competition in the browser market.</p>

        <h3>2000: The Dot-Com Boom and Bust</h3>
        <p>By the year 2000, the internet had become a major part of the global economy, with thousands of companies participating in the dot-com boom. This period saw an explosion of internet-based startups, many of which were focused on e-commerce, technology, and digital content.</p>
        <p>However, the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, leading to a massive downturn in the tech industry. Many companies failed or were sold off, but the internet's infrastructure continued to expand. In 2000, eBay and Amazon solidified their positions as key players in online retail, and Google began its journey to dominate search engines. Despite the crash, the internet’s role in commerce and communication had become irreversible, setting the stage for the next phase of digital innovation.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The period from 1993 to 2000 marked the internet's transition from a research project to a central part of the global economy and daily life. With key technological innovations, the growth of influential companies, and the internet's commercialization, these years laid the foundation for the digital age we live in today.</p>
