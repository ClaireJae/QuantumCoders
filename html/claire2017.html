            <h1>Bitcoin saw its value skyrocket!</h1>
            <p>Who needs an alternative to money that is out of the hands of banks and governments? Enough people, it seems, 
                that interest in bitcoin and other “cryptocurrencies” went mainstream in 2017, sending the price of bitcoin up 
                from underneath $1,000 at the start of the year to more than $14,000 by the end of 2017.</p>
            <h1>Google Assistant</h1>
            <p>In April 2017, the Google Assistant became the first virtual persona with the ability to differentiate people—as many 
                as six—based on their voices. After training it (via a Google Home device) to learn what makes your vocal sounds unique, 
                ask it to read your schedule.</p>
            <h1>Face Recognition on Tickets</h1>
            <p>In June 2017, passengers taking off to Aruba from Boston with JetBlue could keep their boarding passes and passports tucked away. 
                That’s because the carrier started accepting flyers’ faces as ID. A camera at the gate snaps a photo of each traveler, 
                and then U.S. Customs and Border Protection algorithm matches it against a photo of the traveler’s visage on file, giving each voyager the green light.</p>

            <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p>Facebook’s artificial intelligence (AI) research program announced over the summer that its “chatbots” not only developed their own language, 
                but also figured out a way to deceive the humans.</p>
            <h1>Practical Quantum Computers</h1>
            <p>Advances at Google, Intel, and several research groups indicate that computers with previously unimaginable power are finally within reach.</p>
            <h1>NASA Mars Insight</h1>
            <p>NASA planned to make good use of the 2018 window, with the planned launch in May of the Mars InSight lander. Unlike Curiosity and other Mars rovers, this craft was to stay in one place.</p>
