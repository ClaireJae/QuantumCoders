    <p id="info-box" class="sizeTextParagraph">The history of the internet is full of so many 
        memories and incredible events that have happened. 
        The internet was created a long time ago, but was 
        never actually accessed by the people until 1993.
        This is where the crazy journey of this page begins!
        Quinn the doberman dog will lead you into the abyss 
        of the internet. You may struggle but you will find 
        your way back home. Good luck!
